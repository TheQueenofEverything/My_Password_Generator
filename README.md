Project goal:

    Creating a Password Generator (input from a random or pseudo-random number generator that automatically generates a password when clicked)

Project Discription:

    The project was build from scratch with HTML. CSS was used to create the visals of a box/ window with a buttom. At last Javascript was added to the HTML document to generate the passwords.
    
Project Challenges:

    Figuring how to struscture the Javascript document to be semantically correct;
    Understanding the logic behind loop statements that help generate random passwords;

Features to implement in the future:

    Increment 3 password wrappers and program the box to generate 3 passwords at the same time. This is merely about choice. These passwords would be displayed at the same time in the box. This would allow the user to have more choice rather than constantly click the button to change to a desired password.
