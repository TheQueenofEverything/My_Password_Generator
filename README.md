Project goal:

    Creating a Password Generator (input from a random or pseudo-random number generator that automatically generates a password when clicked)

Project description:

    The project was build with HTML from starter code and then modified. CSS was used to create the visals of a box/ window with a 'generate password' buttom and smaller 'on/off'  buttons, allowing the user to select more options regarding the password. Javascript was added to make the web page interactive.
    
Project challenges:

    Figuring how to structure the Javascript document to be semantically correct;
    Understanding the logic behind loop statements that help generate random passwords;
    Organizing the HTML, CSS and Javascript documents, to be concise and in order, so that they can be perciieved as well-oriented/ well-documented files. 

Features to implement in the future:

    More improvements should be made in CSS regarding media queries, so that this password generator can adapt to various screensizes/resolutions.
